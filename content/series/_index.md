Sometimes I have to split posts up into series. Maybe it's because the post would be way too long, maybe I revisited an old idea a few years later or maybe I just didn't feel like finishing the entire idea so I tied a boy on the blog post with intentions to come back to it later while saying "that's tomorrow me's problem". Regardless, here they are.
