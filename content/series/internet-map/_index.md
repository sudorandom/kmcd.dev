The **Internet Infrastructure Map** is an ongoing project to visualize the hidden architecture of our digital world. What began in 2022 as a simple exercise in mapping undersea fiber-optic cables has evolved into a comprehensive study of global connectivity.

Over the years, this series has tracked the growth of the network's physical backbone. In 2023, the map expanded to include **Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)**, visualizing the massive bandwidth capacity that flows through major peering hubs. By 2025, the project transitioned from static visualizations and pre-rendered videos into a fully interactive, web-based experience that allows users to explore the global internet's infrastructure in real-time.

This series documents the engineering hurdles, data archaeology, and design choices involved in bringing order to the chaotic datasets that power the modern Internet.
