The **Internet Infrastructure Map** is an ongoing project to visualize the hidden architecture of our digital world. What began in 2022 as a simple exercise in mapping undersea fiber-optic cables has evolved into a comprehensive study of global connectivity.

Over the years, this series has tracked the growth of the network's physical backbone. In 2023, the map expanded to include **Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)**, visualizing the massive bandwidth capacity that flows through major peering hubs. By 2025, the project transitioned into a fully interactive, web-based experience that allows users to explore the global internet's infrastructure in real-time. The 2026 update adds a layer of "logical dominance" by incorporating **BGP routing tables** to visualize how IP address space is distributed across the globe.

This series documents the engineering hurdles, data archaeology, and design choices involved in bringing order to the chaotic datasets that power the modern Internet.
