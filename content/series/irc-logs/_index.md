These are archived (and totally fictional) logs from various IRC channels, capturing the high-stakes drama, technical debt, and questionable decision-making that occurs when engineering teams are left to their own devices.

From "vibe-coding" supercomputers to the inevitable chaos of remote standups, these logs serve as a satirical look at the specific brands of misery and hilarity unique to the software industry. Any resemblance to your current sprint is purely coincidental (and potentially a sign that you should check your branch protections).
