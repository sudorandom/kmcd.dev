title: "Have you worked on a project that went sideways? What are some lessons that you learned from that experience?"

My answer: I've worked on a project that was far too ambitious and was way beyond the skills that I had at the time. I've learned a LOT from that experience and I think I'm a better... employee because of it. I understand now that once you get the ball moving on a larger effort it is very hard to change trajectory.
