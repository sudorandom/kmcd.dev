My answer: I mostly like to code in my dark office with my atmospheric color LED lines slowly cycling to every color of the rainbow. I also often use a light behind my monitor so that I don't get too much eye strain. I use dark mode everywhere for the same reason. I do like going into the office a few times a week to pick up on conversations at lunch and when getting coffee. It's easier to get on the same page with your coworkers using body language and when you are in a shared space together. I do sometimes like to work from a coffee shop or, if weather permits, sitting near the canal. So I guess my answer is: a mix of everything.
