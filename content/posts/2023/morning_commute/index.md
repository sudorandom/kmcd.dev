One year ago I made the leap and moved from Dallas, Texas to Copenhagen, Denmark with my family. There were many reasons for this move but one of the biggest motivators was to be able to live in a city where cycling was treated as a first-class mode of transportation. Cycling is efficient, great for your health, great for your mental health and is just a more pleasant way to get to work.

Last year I went from never riding a bike (seriously, I had only been on a bike 3 times, ever) to cycling being an integral part of my life. I am so thankful to live in such a bike-friendly city of Copenhagen and I’m lucky to have my new job in the city center. Linked above is an admittedly boring video of my commute to work but being able to bike to work is such an accomplishment for me that I figured I’d share it here.
