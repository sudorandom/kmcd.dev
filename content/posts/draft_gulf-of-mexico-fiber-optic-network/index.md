When I posted my latest iteration of [map of the internet](/posts/internet-map-v2/) I was met with a question from [a user on mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@damngoodtech/110820842818383767). Why is there a fiber cable connecting Texas to Mississippi? Why does it skip Louisiana? Do they just not like Louisiana? Well, that's actually a good question... and one that I'll answer more fully as I explain to you the purpose behind **The Gulf of Mexico Fiber Optic Network** and why it connects weirdly Freeport, Texas to Pascagoula, Mississippi.

### Terrestrial Fiber Optic Cables:
If you connect from a computer in Houston, Texas to another computer in Mobile, Mississippi you almost certainly are not going to use the cable that makes up The Gulf of Mexico Fiber Optic Network. You will, however, use terrestrial fiber optic cables buried under the ground. Buried fiber optic cables play a crucial role in today's internet infrastructure. They are the backbone of long-distance data transmission, carrying vast amounts of internet traffic between cities, countries, and continents. These cables are typically installed underground along roads, railways, or other utility corridors, where they are better protected from environmental hazards and physical damage.

**These buried cables are also COMPLETELY unrepresented on my map of the internet.** That's because, in the US, the network of terrestrial fiber optic cables will look very similar to the interstate highway system. The situation is likely very similar in other countries... but maybe with more cable paths following train tracks instead of roads. There are just too many of them to count. And the data on this is extremely lacking for a number of reasons, like there's no incentive for transit providers to tell everyone where they buried all of their cables so a public database just doesn't exist (as far as I know).

### So what's going on:
On the face of it, the Gulf of Mexico Fiber Optic Network doesn't make sense. There's already a vast number transit links underground, so why would you run this fiber optic cable just to connect Texas to Mississippi? **Ralph Emerson once said "It's not the destination, it's the journey".** This cable isn't about Texas *or* Mississippi. It's about the people and massive amounts of very large equipment that live in the ocean for... **offshore drilling rigs**. That's right, the Gulf of Mexico Fiber Optic Network gives high speed internet to those who live for months on these offshore rigs that pump oil and natural gas out of the sea. These rigs are basically towns that are miraculously placed in the middle of the ocean. In addition to making sure these platforms have sufficient food and water it's also important to have reliable high speed internet connectivity because the people who live and work there for months at a time. It's also extremely useful to have good operational and scientific data from these sites. This data could be useful in preventing the next oil or gas spill, [like the one that set the ocean on fire for several days](https://twitter.com/MLopezSanMartin/status/1411059695503261697).


TODO: make a version of the map with state boundaries drawn (line width should be smaller and/or the color faded to make it clear that these aren't country borders)
TODO: take screenshot of this new map
