In [my last post](/posts/leaving-texas), I talked about the reasons that me and my family decided to leave Texas. But I get this question often, especially from Danes: **Why *Denmark*?** I hope to answer how we came up with Denmark as our family's new home and how it has been in the past two and a half years. I do not intend for this to be a guide for others since the details of bureaucracy change quite often and I think everyone's experience will be very different from ours. Instead, I want to detail what happened with us, so others might have a general sense of what it might be like to make the same life-changing move.

## Why Denmark?
First, let's go over the reasons we chose Denmark.

### Beautiful cities and landscapes
I love the design of many European cities. The historic buildings, the walkable city centers, the metro and train systems, the bus systems that get to most places, etc. So Europe is already very high on our list. There are many places to live in Europe though, so let's continue.

### English Usage
We did realize how hard it would be to live in a country that doesn't have a high proficiency in English so we naturally gravitated towards places that do use English a good amount. With this criteria, we identified Ireland, England, The Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Norway as notable choices.

### Public health care
Health care is a touchy subject for everyone, but I firmly believe that making it a public service is the right choice. I'm tired of seeing fundraising campaigns to cover basic medical expenses. Your level of care shouldn't be decided on how good of a sob story your relatives can give on GoFundMe. I would rather have a giant fundraiser that everyone, by default, pays into and everyone can tap into if they need. Health care in our new country should be mostly a public service. This is the case for many countries so this criterion didn't actually narrow our decision down very much, but this is a notable difference from The United States where health care is an abomination of private hospitals negotiating with private insurance companies to which you only get access to by being a productive worker at a (usually) private company.

### Happy Citizens
It feels silly, but the fact that Denmark [consistently ranks near the top](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2024/happiness-of-the-younger-the-older-and-those-in-between/#ranking-of-happiness-2021-2023) of the happiest citizens tells me something about the society. Yes, this is likely a flawed study but there seems to be some truth to it. People are generally happy and the poverty rate is low. This matches my values.

### Work-life Balance
Denmark has a legal requirement for employees to have five weeks of paid vacation time per year. Many jobs offer a week or two more than that. Non-salary employees also get "vacation pay" which can be used to keep your pay consistent while you take time off for you and your family. Furthermore, the amount of hours for full-time work in Denmark is 37, which is slightly better than the typical 40. People shouldn't be working their lives away in hopes that one day they will be able to retire and finally do the things that they want to do when their health is likely the worst.

### Women also work
Denmark has a very good record for women being able to have careers. The gap between the percentage of women and men working is much lower than in most other countries. Women are very much expected to be a part of society and men are expected to do their share in housework and childcare.

But how does Denmark make this work? How is it possible for so many women to work when there are children to raise? Denmark offers a very generous maternity and paternity leave with up to a year off in total. When the child is one year old, subsidized child care starts and is *extremely* cheap for the quality of care that you get. And from then on, both parents have time to work full-time jobs and continue their careers. It just makes sense. Most citizens here are happy to pay more tax to live in a society where this is how it works. This very much matches my values.

### Weather
You may find it surprising that I would list the weather as a positive for Denmark. In contrast to Texas, it's nowhere near as extreme. There are few-to-no tornados, earthquakes or hurricanes. Occasionally there is a storm with strong winds with flooding but it is nowhere near the amount of destruction of tornados. Why do I care about tornados so much? My house was hit by one in 2019. I was alone with my 6-month-old daughter and it was the scariest few minutes of my life that shook up our lives for the next year. I talked more about this in [my last post](/posts/leaving-texas).

### Biking culture
Denmark has a strong bicycle culture. What I like most about Danish cycling culture is that it's not just the super extreme cyclers who have insanely expensive bikes and full-body suits. It's mostly just normal people who use a bike to get to work because it's the cheapest, fastest and usually the most pleasant way to get places.

### And more
- Literally Vikings
- Our daughter will be bilingual, which is super cool
- World leaders in wind energy
- Wonderful design aesthetic
- Pastries
- Low crime rate
- Very progressive social policies
- probably a lot more things that I am just forgetting to list

## Jumping into the unknown
We decided to *NOT* do a "scouting" vacation so the first time we were to visit Denmark we were moving there. This seems like a strange decision to most people that we talk to but I firmly think we did the right thing for us. We reasoned that we weren't going to learn anything from a vacation that would stop us from at least trying to live there for a year. Vacationing is such a different experience than actually living somewhere and it really is hard to imagine what it is like living somewhere unless you just do it. So we did.

You may ask why we moved when we did. This was the second half of 2021. COVID was still a big deal. our daughter was two years old at the time and we considered that it would get harder and harder for her to learn Danish like a native Danish kid the longer we waited. This was the biggest reason we pulled the trigger as fast as we could.

## Three months before the move
Before our big move, we had a lot of things to settle. We rented an Airbnb for three months so that we could have time to sell almost everything that we owned. Our house. Our cars. And quite literally almost everything else. We took a total of 8 large suitcases, 3 carry-on bags and a stroller (which was destroyed in transit). We packed some clothing, practical items and a few keepsakes. That is all we had to start our new life.

During these three months, I also interviewed for jobs in Denmark. This could be a post all of its own, but when I decided to start applying to jobs in earnest was July of 2021. One thing I didn't know about Denmark at the time is that the *entire month of July* is typically when a lot of Danes take off for their summer vacations. This is because most schools have three weeks in July designated for vacations. I wasn't getting a lot of responses simply because the country was quite literally closed for business. But I stuck to it and eventually got traction on a few jobs which eventually ended up in a pretty good offer that I signed. I quite literally had one of my interviews with someone from their summerhouse. After the offer was agreed to, I started the process for my permit. This required that I travel to Houston to officially submit my paperwork and to have my fingerprint scanned and picture taken. Luckily the closest Danish embassy was relatively close.

Note that I was also working for Apple at this time which, by the way, was a dream job. I only left it so we could expedite the move to Denmark. I did try searching for openings in Denmark for Apple but there really aren't a lof of Apple jobs specifically in Denmark that matched my skills. I will also note that I was interviewing for jobs in The Netherlands as well since it was a very close 2nd place on our short list of places to move to. I did find several opportunities in Amsterdam and I was close to accepting one of them whenever a few people in Denmark decided to check their email while on vacation, thankfully. If things were slightly different, I could be learning Dutch instead of Danish right now.

But I had a job offer, had the process started on getting my work permit and now we had plane tickets to our new home country. It seemed that our plans were finally coming together.

## Day 1
Oddly, the first day was the hardest for me. I can't sleep very well on airplanes so it felt like the longest day on earth. We had two layovers and by the time we got on the third plane, my two-and-a-half-year-old daughter was COMPLETELY over the experience. We were the kind of parents that severely limited our daughter's television-watching time. This has been great so far... Except when you need to entertain a toddler who isn't interested in TV shows for 14 fucking hours. Then it's not so great. She also was far less interested in the experience of being in an airplane than we expected.

After our plane had finally landed at Copenhagen Airport, we had to get to our Airbnb (we had one rented for a month while we got our rental house settled) to check in and get our keys. Remember that we had a large amount of giant and heavy suitcases to contend with and this is when we learned that the "2nd floor" is up two flights of stairs, not one. We also were scheduled to get the keys for the rental house soon after that. Everything took much longer than expected so I was in a rush to get all of our luggage up to the Airbnb in time to get to our appointment. So I moved everything we owned up a few flights of stairs before quickly running/walking to the nearby rental house. We made it. Everything went well but I slept very well on our first night in our new home country.

## Day 2-15
{{< figure src="bikes.png" >}}

On the second day, we bought some bikes, determined to learn how to ride them. Yes, it was downing rain. We got the proper Danish welcoming.

We treated the first few weeks, or so, like a vacation. We walked around and explored our new city like tourists. Then we would come home and build Ikea furniture in our rental house. We ended up only sleeping at the Airbnb for a few days. Once we had a mattress in our rental house there was no way we weren't going to sleep there. We should have realized this but we added a lot of buffer into our plans because the nightmare scenario for us was being stuck without a place to sleep.

{{< figure src="moving.png" >}}

We ended up walking a lot. It's quite insane how much more walking you end up doing whenever most places that you want to go are a walkable distance away. I mentioned cycling culture as a positive for the country but at this point, I did not know how to ride a bicycle. So we ended up learning how to use the bus and metro system. We opted to NOT purchase a car. This ended up being an amazing decision for us because Copenhagen is perfectly navigable without needing a car.

Bureaucracy is a little difficult when you don't speak the language. In Denmark there is a specific order of when you can do certain things... and some steps took a surprisingly large amount of time, like onboarding to a Danish bank. It was a ridiculous amount of time before I was able to receive my first paycheck (3 months). We luckily planned on much worse things and had plenty of savings to use in the meantime.

## The first year
The first year went by so quickly. I was super excited about every little cultural difference. It sounds very strange but grocery shopping took a while to adjust to. Not only was everything in a language we didn't understand (we expected that) but it's strange how much you rely on familiar types of packaging and brands when shopping. It's funny because *now* I can't even sympathize too much with my past self. I don't even remember the specifics behind what was so difficult.

I started my new job. We figured out how to sign my daughter up for kindergarten. My wife got a part-time job near home. We rebuilt our wardrobe since we weren't able to take a lot of clothes over with us. I took a stab at learning Danish but I did this with a fully online class and none of the lessons "stuck" for me, and life ended up getting in the way so I would consider this attempt as a failure.

The weather did take some adjustment. We intellectually knew that the winters would be dark but there's nothing that really prepares for so many dark days. There was a time soon after New Year's when I just wanted it to stop being so dammed dark all the time. But other seasons eventually came. This is when I realized that Denmark may have the perfect spring, summer and autumn weather for me so maybe I can tolerate the dark winters.

### Surprising differences that I have noticed during the first year:
- Very rare small talk with strangers. To me, it seems like the people who do strike up small talk are not from Denmark.
- Americans are loud. I thought of myself as a quiet person but I often felt like I was scream-talking compared to those around me. I have (hopefully) adjusted my speaking volume lower.
- Transit etiquette: everyone is extremely quiet.
- Copenhagen can be incredibly quiet in general. People talk at low volumes, cars don't go incredibly fast and there are no air conditioning units everywhere that pump out large amounts of background noise. It's often quiet. And pleasant.
- No tipping
- Fireworks: Danes are absolutely insane about fireworks. They fire them off at random times and places in the city in the weeks leading up to New Year's. It's absolutely crazy and the smoke and noise can make an otherwise quiet night look like a war zone. It all builds up in a crescendo on New Year's evening to what can only be described as the noise of World War III. Dogs don't have a good time in Danish cities during this time.
- Feeling of safety; my wife often has to work late nights and has never felt unsafe walking home alone. This is a dramatic difference from where we come from.
- Children with cigarettes and walking beer. I will never get used to this. The lack of open carry laws and the drinking age for beer is age 16.
- Danes don't seem to like using weed killer to kill grass that sprouts up between paving stones. Instead, you will see old people with a hand-held frame thrower burning off the unwanted plant matter.
- No car; I haven't missed having a car. It's so freeing to not have one in a city with many alternative modes of transportation.
- Weird traditions: During a holiday called Fastelavn there's a tradition of getting a barrel with a black cat in it and beating the barrel until the cat gets out. They no longer use a cat but the barrel remains, usually filled with candy instead. There's also a Midsummer holiday called Sankt Hans Aften where Danes gather to burn witches. Again, they no longer use real witches but the symbolism is kind of nuts when you first hear about it.

## The second year
Our second year a lot of things clicked into place. Our lease was running out for our rental house so we decided to look for a more permanent place to stay. We ended up finding an apartment that we loved and ended up purchasing it. There are a lot of caveats when purchasing real estate in Denmark as a non-permanent resident so many people may not have the ability to do what we did. To get financing you usually have to put down a lot for a down payment before banks will work with you as a foreigner. Additionally, the Danish government can just say "no" if you haven't lived in Denmark for more than 5 years. Those are only some of the issues with buying an apartment like we did. Please look these things up yourself and it's customary to hire a lawyer to help during the process of buying real estate. With all that said, it all went very smoothly for us. The process is, by far, more streamlined and easier than the process in the United States. I don't think I physically signed a single thing during the entire process.

I listed a bunch of cultural differences in the last section. Well, there's not much to note here because I don't come across them often anymore... or at least not many of these things seem as strange anymore.

The second year is when I really started reliably riding my bike. As my legs got stronger I transitioned from a heavy e-bike to a normal city bike. It was stolen once (I recovered it thanks to a hidden Airtag) and I got tired of carrying around the battery. I now bike 2-3 times a week to work and Danish class. It is still tiring but that is because I can't seem to force myself to go slower than my "max speed" when cycling. I always seem to want to go at a pace that pushes my limits.

After learning my lesson, I'm physically going to Danish class now and it has been working a lot better for me. I'm at a weird skill level now where I can understand a good number of conversations but it's still challenging for me to form sentences on the fly and all of it is still exhausting. I think this is the point where I can start saturating my mind with Danish shows, newspapers, magazines, books and music so my brain starts thinking in Danish more naturally. But it's going well. My daughter is 5 years old now and is speaking Danish fluently. Our plan of bringing her over early enough to grasp the language like a native speaker has worked exceedingly well.

## What now?
Our family is set on staying here for the long haul. There are some big dates to keep an eye on: passport renewals, visa extensions for me and my family, and applying for permanent residency.

Other than waiting, I have two requirements that I need to actively work on for permanent residency: pass a higher level of Danish and pass an active citizen exam. Then I wait for my 4 years of employment to pass and I can apply. For citizenship, there's a much more difficult exam and I have to wait *9 years* before I can apply. These requirements can and often do change.
