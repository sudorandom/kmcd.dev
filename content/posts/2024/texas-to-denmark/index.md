In [my last post](/posts/leaving-texas), I talked about the reasons that me and my family decided to leave Texas. But I get this question often: **Why *Denmark*?** I hope to answer how we came up with Denmark as our family's new home and how it has been in the past two and a half years.

## Why Denmark?
First, let's go over the reasons we chose Denmark.

### Beautiful cities and landscapes
I love the design of many European cities. The historic buildings, the walkable city centers, the metro and train systems, the bus systems that get to most places, etc. So Europe is already very high on our list. There are many places to live in Europe though, so let's continue.

### English Usage
We did realize how hard it would be to live in a country that doesn't have a high proficiency in English so we naturally gravitated towards places that do have a high proficiency in English. With this criteria, we identified Ireland, England, The Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Norway as notable choices.

### Public health care
Health care is a touchy subject, but I firmly believe that making it a public service is the right choice. I'm tired of seeing fundraising campaigns to cover basic medical expenses. I'd rather have a giant fundraiser that everyone, by default, pays into and everyone can tap into if they need. Health care in our new country should be mostly a public service. This is the case for many countries and didn't actually narrow our decision down very much. This matches my values.

### Happy Citizens
It feels silly, but the fact that Denmark [consistently ranks near the top](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2024/happiness-of-the-younger-the-older-and-those-in-between/#ranking-of-happiness-2021-2023) of the happiest citizens tells me something about the society. Yes, this is likely a flawed study but there seems to be some truth to it. People are generally happy and the poverty rate is low. This matches my values.

### Work-life Balance
Denmark has a legal requirement for employees to give five weeks of paid vacation time per year. Many jobs offer a week or two more than that. Non-salary employees also get "vacation pay" which can be used to keep your pay consistent while you take time off. Furthermore, the amount of hours for full-time work in Denmark is 37 hours. This matches my values. People shouldn't be working their lives away in hopes that one day they will be able to retire and finally do the things that they want to do when their health is likely the worst.

### Women also work
Denmark has a very good record for women being able to have careers. The gap between the percentage of women and men working is much lower than in most countries. Women are very much expected to be a part of society and men are expected to do their share in housework and childcare.

But how does Denmark make this work? How is it possible for so many women to work when there are children to raise? Denmark offers a very generous maternity and paternity leave with up to a year off in total. When the child is one year old, subsidized child care starts and is *extremely* cheap for the quality of care that you get. And from then on, both parents have time to work full-time jobs and continue their careers. It just makes sense. Most citizens here are happy to pay more tax to live in a society where this is how it works. This very much matches my values.

### Weather
You may find it surprising that I would list the weather as a positive for Denmark. In contrast to Texas, it's nowhere near as extreme. There are few-to-no tornados, earthquakes or hurricanes. Occasionally there is a storm with strong winds with flooding but it is nowhere near the amount of destruction of tornados. Why do I care about tornados so much? My house was hit by one in 2019. I was alone with my 6-month-old daughter and it was the scariest few minutes of my life that shook up our lives for the next year.

### Biking culture
Denmark has a strong bicycle culture. What I like most about Danish cycling culture is that it's not just the super extreme cyclers who have insanely expensive bikes and full-body suits. It's mostly just normal people who use a bike to get to work because it's the cheapest, fastest and usually the most pleasant way to get places.

### And more
- Literally Vikings
- Our daughter will be bilingual, which is super cool
- World leaders in wind energy
- Wonderful design aesthetic
- Pastries
- Low crime rate
- Very progressive social policies

## Immigrant Attitude
We decided to *NOT* do a "scouting" vacation so the first time we were to visit Denmark we were moving there. This seems like a strange decision to most people that we talk to but I firmly think we did the right thing for us. We figured that we weren't going to learn anything from a vacation that would stop us from at least trying to live there for a year. Vacationing is such a different experience than actually living somewhere and it really is hard to imagine what it is like living somewhere unless you just do it.

You may ask why we moved when we did. This was at the end of 2021. COVID was still a big deal. our daughter was two years old at the time and we considered that it would get harder and harder for her to learn Danish like a native Danish kid the longer we waited. This was the biggest reason we pulled the trigger as fast as we could.

Expat vs immigrant


## The first month
The first month is, by far, the hardest...

- Walking a lot. A LOT.
- Learn how to use the bus and metro system
- Bureaucracy is a little crazy when you don't speak the language. In Denmark there is a specific order of when you can do certain things... and some steps took a surprisingly large amount of time, like onboarding to a bank.
- Treated the first month or so like a vacation
- No tipping
- Very rare small talk with strangers
- Transit etiquette
- Americans are loud

## The first year
Super excited about every cultural difference.
Everything takes more time, re-learning how to eat and grocery shop
Learning about the Danish education system
Building up proper clothing
First attempt at learning Danish
Adjusting to the weather. Winter is coming. I had the hardest time in the period after New Year's. There's much more variety between the seasons here. Summers are amazing and bright. Winters are very dark and a little cold.
If you manage to make Danish friends, hang on to them because they're priceless. Danes can be seen as hard to become good friends with, but if you put in work to a friendship they will, too. Personally, I'm absolutely terrible at making friends but luckily I have my wife, who is in a very social job at a craft beer bar.

Surprising differences:
- Fireworks
- Feeling of safety
- Children with cigarettes and walking beer
- Kill grass between bricks with flamethrowers

My job and adjusting our lifestyle
 - No car
 - BÃ¸rnehave (kindergarten) pickup times

## The second year
Most cultural differences are no longer novel. I can ride a bike very well now.
Learned to ride a bike
Started learning Danish in earnest

## Onward
Danish class
Path to permanent residency
Path to citizenship
Rules change a lot, so you can't plan TOO far ahead: (stay calm, learn Danish, do good work)
