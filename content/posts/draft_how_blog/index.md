## Why
Why would I build my own blog and why not use some of the existing platforms? The answer is... well, I've been bit too many times. Many times platforms will change their business model and decide to either charge for the service. Having a static website makes it super easy to switch providers. Many people offer free hosting for static files.

## Why Static?
Why would someone use a static website generator over a platform made for blogs?

Hugo
Github pages
Cloudflare
