Journal Entry #2

Today was a whirlwind of excitement and revelations at the Red Mist Nuclear Power Facility. As I settled into my role as a safety inspector, I couldn't help but be captivated by the wonders this facility had to offer. The benefits it provided to the world were beyond anything I had imagined.

I spent much of the day talking to engineers and colleagues, eager to learn about the groundbreaking advancements made possible by the surplus energy generated here. It was astonishing to hear about the myriad applications of this tremendous power.

They are as follows:

- The first remarkable revelation was the development of new carbon capture techniques. The reactor's energy surplus enabled the capture and storage of vast amounts of carbon dioxide, contributing significantly to the fight against climate change.
- Another awe-inspiring application was the field of desalinization. With the abundant energy available, purifying seawater had become a feasible and sustainable solution to address the global water crisis.
- The surplus power also opened up new possibilities in computing. Larger supercomputers were being constructed to harness the immense energy and processing capabilities, advancing scientific research and computational capabilities exponentially.
- Intriguingly, there were mentions of synthesized new types of matter, but the colleagues were hesitant to elaborate further. It appeared that the research in this area was not yet published, hinting at revolutionary discoveries yet to be revealed.

As the day progressed, my supervisor, David Bennett, provided a description of how the power plant worked. To my surprise, it seemed to follow the conventional principles of a nuclear power plant: a nuclear reaction boiled water, creating steam to turn turbines and generate electricity. However, the devil was in the details, and everyone remained evasive about the specifics of the "reaction" itself.

The most puzzling aspect was the fact that the reactor seemingly operated without conventional fuel. It was indeed a head-scratcher to imagine a nuclear reactor functioning without the need for fuel, and I was told that this was one of the closely guarded secrets of the facility.

Throughout the day, I couldn't shake the lingering questions about the reactor's operation. It was hard to comprehend the concept of seemingly unlimited energy generation, and I wondered how this technology could exist without altering the very fabric of our understanding of the universe.

Before writing this entry I played with my new Van de Graaff generator. It's that neat machine that has a ball on top that arcs lightning to your finger when you're about to touch it. It also makes your hair stand up. It's not really dangerous because the amount of current that the device produces is pretty small... but it may hurt a little bit. I got this as a neat party trick. Maybe if I spent more time actually talking to people socially and making friends I would be invited to more parties. Instead, I spend my time reading up on quirky physics facts and playing with gadgets.

Tomorrow, I will continue my quest for answers, seeking ways to penetrate the walls of secrecy that shroud this remarkable facility. I believe that understanding the truth behind this revolutionary power source is essential not just for my job but for the welfare of humanity as a whole. But first, sleep.
