Here are copies of the updates that I have posted to my social media account on Mastodon: [@sudorandom@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@sudorandom). I feel like it's a good idea to have personal backups of social media postings. You can follow on [mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/@sudorandom) or with [RSS](https://infosec.exchange/@sudorandom.rss).
