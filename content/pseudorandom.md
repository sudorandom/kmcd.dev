**No worries, mistakes happen!**

**Pseudorandomness** is a fancy way of saying something appears random even though it's actually created by a set of rules. For more on pseudorandomness, check out Wikipedia: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness).

`sudorandom` is a play on words combining "pseudorandom" and the [`sudo`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo) command in Linux. `sudo` lets you run commands with higher privileges, kind of like giving yourself admin access. I like the name `sudorandom` because it makes me think of messing around on the Linux command line with all the power in the world... maybe a little too much power.
