It’s okay, we all make mistakes. *Pseudorandomness* is the property of being generated by a deterministic process but appearing random.

[See more about pseudorandomness on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness).

**sudorandom** is a pun based on **pseudorandom** and the `sudo` linux command. The `sudo` command raises the security privileges of the command being executed. It stands for “super user do”. I like this name because, to me, it evokes an image in my mind of doing random things on a linux command line... with admin privileges. 😈
