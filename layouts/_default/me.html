                    Hello! My name is <strong>Kevin McDonald</strong>. I am a <strong>software engineer</strong> living
                    in Copenhagen.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Having grown up in <strong>Texas</strong>, mostly around the DFW area, I now find myself living in
                    the beautiful city of <strong>Copenhagen, Denmark</strong>. In 2021, my wife and I decided to embark
                    on this adventure to raise our daughter and embrace a new way of living. As a part of this new life,
                    I've taken up cycling as my main mode of transportation (I don't even own a car!), and I'm even
                    learning Danish. My daughter attends a Danish kindergarten and is growing up bilingual. At this
                    point she identifies more as Danish than American. This journey has been difficult at times but it
                    has also been incredibly rewarding.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Video games used to be a big part of how I spent my free time. I got really into Halo/Halo 2 in high
                    school, World of Warcraft in college and Eve Online in my 20s (see the Evepraisal project below).
                    Now-a-days I really only play casual games, usually roguelikes, but the interest is still there. I
                    just don't have the time!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I read Sci-Fi and fantasy books, usually in audiobook form. I sometimes read non-fiction on topics
                    like popular science and software engineering.

                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Cloud#SoftLayer">SoftLayer</a> (before and after IBM). I
                    currently work for <a href="https://sybogames.com">SYBO</a>. If you want the full details of my work
                    history, see my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudorandom/" target="_blank">profile on

                    I began my career pursuing "full stack" but now I am solidly a backend engineer. I have gravitated
                    more towards backend systems, and specifically internal tools. However, I have a wide variety of
                    experiences. I have been the primary developer for several public-facing products. I have delved
                    into data engineering with designing ETL pipelines, network pollers, and metric systems. I've
                    developed insights that have made measurable impacts on product design and has directly led to
                    saving and earning millions of dollars monthly. I have also dipped my toe into cybersecurity by
                    looking at the attack surface of my current company's APIs and developed reasonable exploits and
                    proof of concepts to demonstrate the need to focus on this topic more. This has directly lead to
                    fixing those particular exploits, more attention to security best practices and was a piece of
                    evidence for creating a real cybersecurity team at that company.

                    I tend to get interested in network protocols and dissecting how they work. I have dived deep into
                    gRPC, SNMP, HTTP/2, gNMI, NETCONF and TL1. I don't see myself stopping any time soon with this. My
                    current working programming language is <strong>Go</strong>, but I have previously worked with
                    <strong>Elixir, Clojure, Python, Java, and PHP</strong> as my working programming language in the
                    past.

                    a pun. It mixes "sudo" (which gives a single linux command super user privileges) with
                    "pseudorandom" like things that seem unpredictable but are computer-made, so they follow strict
                    rules.
